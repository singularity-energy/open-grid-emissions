## About the Open Grid Emissions Initiative
Open Grid Emissions is a [Singularity Energy](https://singularity.energy/) initiative that seeks to fill a critical need for high-quality, publicly-accessible, hourly grid emissions data for greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting, policy-making, energy attribute certificate markets, and academic research. It includes a public dataset of hourly, monthly, and annual U.S. electric grid generation, greenhouse gas, and air pollution data, all calculated using open-source, well-documented, and validated methodologies based on the best available science. We believe this to be the most comprehensive, accurate, and high-resolution public dataset of emissions and generation from the U.S. power sector available to date. The initiative grew out of an earlier research project proposed by researchers and data scientists at the University of California Davis and Catalyst Cooperative that won the U.S. EPAâ€™s [EmPOWER Air Data Challenge](https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/empower-air-data-challenge). As an open-source research initiative, it will always be free and open, and we invite contributions from others to continue improving it. For more information about the vision for this project, please see [this blog post](https://medium.com/singularity-energy/introducing-the-open-grid-emissions-initiative-42f68f3b3f49).

## Using this documentation
This documentation describes the data sources, methodologies, and steps used to produce the current version of the Open Grid Emissions dataset. The navigation bar on the left can be used to explore the documentation. If you have questions about this documentation or notice any issues with it, please do not hesitate to contact us at oge (at) singularity (dot) energy.

## Documentation for previous versions
As of August 2023, we will begin maintaining stoplight versions of the OGE documentation for only the current version and the most recent previous version (which can be accessed using the dropdown in the sidebar). Documentation for versions prior to that will be archived in the `docs/` folder of the version release zip file. Documentation for versions prior to v0.2.2 (0.1.0 - 0.2.1) can be found at https://github.com/singularity-energy/open-grid-emissions-docs, in separate branches that are named for each versioned release.
